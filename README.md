# LearningPython
Simple Projects I made to teach myself Python
In the Spring semester of 2019 I plan on expanding my Python knowledge through a Python research project using NLTK and 
a Python Twitter Scraper. These small projects, Codingbat.com, and other projects I made but can't seem to find anymore, all helped me 
prepare and refresh my knowledge of PYthon.
